	<b>Acquisition Log:</b>
	<p><b>12-04-1945: </b> The Object was found on level B3 at Geheime-Berg-Labor 4, a recently captured Nazi research facility found near [REDACTED], Northern [REDACTED]. 
	Sub-Basement 3 was a facility that seemed to be focussing on Research mainly focussed around the re inaction of apparently 'Supernatural' rituals found in texts reclaimed by Nazi forces
	from the Benediktbeuern Monastery, [REDACTED]. An accidental containment breach [REDACTED] leading to the loss of approximately [REDACTED] and 3 M-1 Abram's tanks.</p>
	<p><b>22-08-1945: </b>Containment for the Object was tentatively re-establised at Site 41, [REDACTED]. Due to the Object's memetic properties information pertaining to the Object cannot exist outside of the 
	immediate area of effect (~5m). This effectively means that anything except the broadest most general information as well as, for unknown reasons, information concerning the Object's reacquisition from Nazi Germany.</p>
	<p><b>15-11-1972: </b>Due to the Objects primary (and so-far only known) effect of information destruction this log has lost every entry between 1945 and the Present, including the breach [REDACTED] until 1971 
	and every designation number the Object is given. After rigorous testing so far only a single fact has been learned, the Object is not perfectly spherical. Testing Suspended pending Overseer judgement.</p>
	<p><b>18-11-1972: </b>Testing Suspended Indefinitely.</p>
	<p><b>01-12-20__: </b>Due to the inability for any information to be transported more than ~5m away from the Object the only possible method of termination has been ruled by Overseer [REDACTED] 
	to be massive amounts of highly charged [REDACTED] to be introduced at close range, randomly to the object. This will incur an estimated cost of [REDACTED] million dollars, as well as an unknown number of site personnel.
	Termination order approved unanimously by Site Command.</p>
	<br>
	<b>Instructions:</b>
	<p>Use the mouse or the arrow keys to control the Object.</p>
	<p><b>WARNING:</b> Switching from Keyboard to Mouse controls can cause unexpected jumps!</p>
	<p>Avoid the crates of [REDACTED], these will damage, and eventually destroy you.</p>
	<p>[REDACTED] can only afford enough crates for 8 Waves. Survive this to prevent destruction.</p>
	<p><b>Good Luck</b></p>
